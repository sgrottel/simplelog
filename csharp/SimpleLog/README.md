# SGrottel SimpleLogâ„¢ for CSharp
Version: 3.2.0

A very simple log files implementation.
Logs strings with time stamps into log files and implements log file retention.
Integrates via source component (e.g. single header file for cpp), not a lib.


## Integrate in CSharp Project
There are two ways to add SimpleLogâ„¢ to your CSharp project:

1. Copy and add the subdirectory [./csharp/SimpleLog](./csharp/SimpleLog) to your project.
   While it is sufficient to only add the file [./csharp/SimpleLog/SimpleLog.cs](./csharp/SimpleLog/SimpleLog.cs) to your project, it is recommended to add the whole subdirectory with all files.
   Make sure that `SimpleLog.cs` is compiled as part of your project.
2. Add the nuget package [SGrottel.SimpleLog.CSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SGrottel.SimpleLog.CSharp/) to your project
