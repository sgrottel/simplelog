# SGrottel SimpleLogâ„¢ for Cpp
Version: 3.1.0

A very simple log files implementation.
Logs strings with time stamps into log files and implements log file retention.
Integrates via source component (e.g. single header file for cpp), not a lib.


## Integrate in Cpp Project
There are two ways to add SimpleLogâ„¢ to your Cpp project:

1. Copy and add the subdirectory [./cpp/SimpleLog](./cpp/SimpleLog) to your project.
   While it is sufficient to only add the file [./cpp/SimpleLog/SimpleLog.hpp](./cpp/SimpleLog/SimpleLog.hpp) to your project, it is recommended to add the whole subdirectory with all files.
2. Add the nuget package [SGrottel.SimpleLog.Cpp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SGrottel.SimpleLog.Cpp/) to your project

After integration, you should be able to include the header file via:
```cpp
#include "SimpleLog/SimpleLog.hpp"
```
You might need to adjust your project configurations for a matching include search path.
